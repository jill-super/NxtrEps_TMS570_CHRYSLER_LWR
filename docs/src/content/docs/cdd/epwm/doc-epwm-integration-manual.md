## Global Data

The following global symbols must be defined in CDD_Data.c and .h (populated by PwmCdd):

1. uint16: CDD_DCPhsComp_Cnt_G_u16[3]
1. uint16: CDD_PWMPeriod_Cnt_G_u16

## Component Conflicts

This component replaces an existing NHET component.  The ePWM component contains the NHET program specific to ePWM operation.  In addition, the Ap_ePWM2 developer component replaces the Ap_Nhet2 component.


## Include Path

The “include” directory of this SWC needs to be included in the integration project include search path.


## ADC2 Changes

The ePWM module must be configured to start ADC conversions for the ADC2 module.  This is configured by setting the following register values for the ADC2 module:

1. G0SRC = 3 (EPWM_A1)
1. G1SRC = 1 (EPWM_B)
This is done in parallel with pin multiplexing changes to route the appropriate SOCA and SOCB signals to the ADC2 module.  See FDD 33E for more information.


## Configurator Changes


### DIO and IOHwAb

If NHET was previously used to generate PWM signals, reassignments are required (as the ePWM outputs will conflict with assigned DIO pins).  This is hardware-dependent; refer to the program’s Resource Allocation sheet or schematic.  The following pins are used by ePWM and the ePWM-specific NHET on the TMS570LS1227 PGE (144 pin) package (see the datasheet for more information):


### Port


#### Pin Direction Settings

The changes in DIO (hardware-dependent) may require updates to the pin direction and other settings for the newly configured DIO signals.


#### Multiplexing Changes

Several multiplexing options must be configured for both external routing (peripherals to pins) and internal routing (peripherals to peripherals).

The following changes must be made within configurator:

1. Multiplexing for DIO changes (hardware-dependent)
1. Multiplexing for NHET component change
1. This should result in PINMUX1[8-15] being set to 0x04
1. While N2HET2[8] and [10] can be configured, configurator does not generate these values correctly (see the manual configuration below)
1. ADC Trigger Table – select ADC Trigger Table 2
1. This should result in PINMUX30[0-7] being set to 0x02
The following changes must be made with manual edits to Port_PBcfg.c:

* Configurator does not define symbols for these registers.  Define the following symbols manually:

#define PORT_BASE_ADDR_PINMUX_31  ((Port_RegisterPtrType)(0xFFFFEB8C))

#define PORT_BASE_ADDR_PINMUX_35  ((Port_RegisterPtrType)(0xFFFFEB9C))

#define PORT_BASE_ADDR_PINMUX_37  ((Port_RegisterPtrType)(0xFFFFEBA4))

#define PORT_BASE_ADDR_PINMUX_38  ((Port_RegisterPtrType)(0xFFFFEBA8))

A default value of 0x01 should be used for bytes not otherwise defined.


# Runnable Scheduling

This section specifies the required runnable scheduling.


# Memory Mapping


## Mapping

* Each …START_SEC… constant is terminated by a …STOP_SEC… constant as specified in the AUTOSAR Memory Mapping requirements.
